Covers notes for adding Reach Entity Attributes into a 1.19.2 project.

- Under "build.gradle" in dependencies, this line will be used.

    `modImplementation("com.jamieswhiteshirt:reach-entity-attributes:${project.rea_version}")`

- To define "rea_version" place this under your dependencies section in "gradle.properties"

    `rea_version=2.3.0`

- This version of REA is used for 1.19.2, also iin "build.gradle" under repositories, place:

    `maven {
     		url "https://maven.jamieswhiteshirt.com/libs-release"
     		content {
     			includeGroup "com.jamieswhiteshirt"
     		}
     	}`

- This defines the maven artifactory for REA and where the gradle project defines the dependency from.

- To implement these changes, simply re-sync your gradle project.

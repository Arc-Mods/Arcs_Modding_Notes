This section covers notes for Item classes.

- If an Item class is made, name it using your mod's name or ID and then suffix Items, rather than "ModItems" since it can conflict with other mods.
    For Example: "BasemodItems"
- This is good because it defines the mod's name, "Basemod" and suffixes "Items" to indicate that it is an Item registration class.

- Note that conflicts will *usually* only occur if you have the same class names under the same package in multiple mods.
    My mods use "media.arc" as the main package, so multiple of my weaponry mods have "media.arc.item" which is where the issues can happen.

- If an item has its own class for special functionality, make sure in the Items class ("BasemodItems") instead of using "new Item()", use "new BaseItem()"

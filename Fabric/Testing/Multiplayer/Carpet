Covers a simple section for running some testing using Carpet

- Fake Players, can be controlled via the commands for them.
    To summon one, run this command in-game.

    /player [name or UUID] spawn

- Do note that there is an option to have the fake player spawned in
  any gamemode or at any coordinate, generally, spawn the player in survival.

    /player [name/UUID] spawn in survival

- This also applies for the coordinate, using:

    /player [Name/UUID] spawn at [coord]

- Another thing to note: The player will be removed from the server/world after dying,
  leaving a player left message, since Single-player runs an integrated server.
